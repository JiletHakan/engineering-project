Project - Web application
A pharmacy stock management web application. The goal of this project is to manage the inventory of medicines in a pharmacy, keeping track of purchases, sales, and the stock on hand. Additionally, the application will calculate the profit by deducting the purchase cost from the selling price. 
In this project, I will be utilizing Docker containers to enhance the deployment and scalability of the application.

Please run the container and write ' phyton app.py ' command to the terminal.
